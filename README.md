# FirstRepository
### ***This is the first repository for this account***
Hello, I have made this account for uploading my projects. \
I am learning AI and It's cool. I recommend you to try it. \
I know Python - C++ and some html - css - typescript and a little assembly. \
I really like technology and computers and one of my favorite hobbies is working and coding. \
NGL like this is the true hobby for every programmer in my oppinion. \
I live currently in Iran and It is great for me. \
# My story about programming
First I was like sittin at the computer and thinking "I want a app which simulates how to install windows. Because not many people know how to install windows." \
So my first main motive was this HOWEVER there were other motives I think like because I learned computers it was cool and etc... \
I don't really remember this part but I think I found a website or video IDK. \
I saw a language which was about games and something. the author said how they made games in this language. \
I WAS EXCITED TO LEARN IT SO I STARTED TO remember it But I think I forgot the language's name or I think I wasn't interested AGAIN I don't remember and IDK why? \
I searched the web and FOUND a website which I think said "Best languages to learn" or something. \
I saw the first thing and IT WAS PYTHON. \
So I learned python. \
I won't get into the details but I first I think downloaded a pdf file for python after I THINK trying to read off the website or something but then I found a free video course about python. \
I learned it. \
Many years later many courses later and ... \
I WAS BORED. I really wanted to make games so I learned C++ cuz some person on his youtube vid mentioned how he chose unity over ... and unreal uses C++ \
I WANTED TO LEARN IT. \
It again being a free course \
### Notice that I watched some of the courses like python ones full but C++ and other ones I loved to research like I entered "E" in the visual studio for C++ and found something starting with "E" and I learnt it and cuz everything is so chained together I learned LOTS of concepts like from a function starting with "E"
HTML , ... was also a course \
My brother was having the HTML course live classes but gave up and I impresonated him (My mom and brother agreed) that I would be named my brother but I was behind the screen. \
And I LEARNT some of it. \
NGL I forgot most of it cuz I don't use it often. \
# There are more stories but I am too tired to write it but I will update this post!
SOOOOOOO I hope this explained everything!
